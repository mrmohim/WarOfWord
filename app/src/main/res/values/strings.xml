    <string name="basics_text">
        Players take turns making words from a 5x5 board of tiles. 
        Tap letters from anywhere on the board to assemble a word, then tap 
        \"SUMBIT\" to turn those tiles your color.

    <string name="word_rules_text">
        - Words must have at least two letters\n- Words may only be played 
        once\n- Words may not be a prefix of a previously played word. For 
        example, if Player 1 plays the word "QUILTS", Player 2 cannot play 
        "QUILT" (but "QUILTED" and "QUIT" would both be fine). Prefixes are 
        literal, so QUART is a prefix of QUARTZ. And variations of words may be 
        played, e.g. SHORTED after SHORT.\n- No proper nouns (i.e. Capitalized 
        words), abbreviations, or acronyms.

        You can protect a tile from being stolen by surrounding it with other 
        tiles of the same color. Players may use defended tiles to make a word, 
        but they won\'t change color.\n Note that defended tiles aren\'t 
        permanent, they will become vulnerable if their neighbors change color.

    <string name="ending_the_game_text">
        Your score is the number of tiles that are your color. The game ends 
        when every tile on the board has a color - or - when both players pass 
        their turn in a round. Then the tiles are tallied, and the player with 
        the highest score wins!
